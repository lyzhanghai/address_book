# Ginger Address Book
This is a simple address book.

## Prerequisite
- Python 3
- SQLite3
- Peewee [Installation command `pip3 install peewee`]

## Design questions
* Q: Find person by email address (can supply any substring, ie. "comp" should
  work assuming "alexander@company.com" is an email address in the address
  book) - discuss how you would implement this without coding the solution.
* A: To implement this we could simply use some library that indexes items and offers full-text search. If we 
  use 'in' to look 'substr' into a string, then this solution might become too expensive.
